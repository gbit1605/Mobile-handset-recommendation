<------------------     Mobile Handset Recommendation     ------------------>

This project comprises of 4 parts:

    Data acquisition and cleaning
    Data pre-processing
    Knn algorithm for recommendation and accuracy calculations
    A UI for choosing among different handsets to obtain recommendations

The project can be run by the following these steps:
1. Run app_runner.py file
2. Goto http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in the browser
3. Click on the model names to yield their descriptions and 5 related recommendations

3 graphs have been generated for analysis as follows:
1. Price vs Ratings
2. Price vs Number of Positive Ratings
3. Number of phones per price range

Accuracy measure used: Precision

Precision = (recommended âˆ© relevant) / recommended 

Here, recommended is the number of recommedations given for each product and relevant are the number of recommendations that have a value lower than that of a dynamic threshold. The dynamic threshold, in this case has been defined as, (avg of the five recommedation distances + distance value of recommendation 5 / 5) where recommedation 1 is the closest match and recommedation 5 is the farthest. 

NOTE: Only a few companies from the dataset have been added to the UI but the project can be scaled as per requirement.
